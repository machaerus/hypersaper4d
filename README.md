# HyperSaper4d

This is probably the most unplayable game in the world, which literally cannot be won.

Technically, it's a version of the well-known Minesweeper, just set up in a sci-fi 4-dimensional space, and played in a simulated commandline control center.

You can try it out here, completely for free:

Only in Polish for now, sorry!

Have fun.
